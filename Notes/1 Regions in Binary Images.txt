- In binary image a pixel can take on exactly one of two values.
- these values are often thought of as representing the 'foreground' and 'background' in the image. 
- An object is a group of touching foreground pixels; that is, connected binary region. 

# Finding image regions
- Region labeling and Region coloring are the main process wehere we determine the location of a pixel in a region, number of regions and the location of the regions. 
- Neighboring pixels are pieced together in a stepwise manner to build regions in which all pixels within that region are assigned a unique  number ("lable") for identification
- There two methods for labeling 1. Flood filling, 2. Sequential region marking. 

1. Flood Filling 
----------------------
A region is filled in all directions starting from a single point or seed within the region

2. Sequential Region marking
-----------------------------
Image is traversed from top to bottom, marking regions as they are encountered. 

Floood Filling
---------------------
Search for an unmarked foreground pixel and then fill (visit and mark) all the rest of the neighboring piel in its region. 

Algorithm 1 Region marking
----------------------------
REGIONLABELING(I)
    I: binaryImage, I(u,v) = 0: background, I(u,v) = 1: foreground
    The Image I is labeled (destructively modified) and returned

    Let m <- 2                    -> Value of the next label to be assigned
    for all image coordinate (u,v) do 
        if I(u,v) = 1 THEN 
            FLOODFILL(I, u, v, m)
            m <- m + 1
        RETURN the labeled image I 

FLOODFILLING (I, u, v, label)
    Create Empty Stack Search
    Put the Seed coordinate (u,v) on to the stack: PUSH(S,(u,v))
    while S is not empty do 
        Get the next cooridinate from the top of the stack: 
            (x,y) <- POP (S)
        if (x,y) is inside the image and I(x,y) == 1 then 
        SET I(x,y) <-label 
        PUSH (S, (x+1, y))
        PUSH (X, (x, y+1))
        PUSH (S, (x-1, y))
        PUSH (S, (x, y-1))
        
    return 


    SEQUENTIAL REGION LABELING

    - it is a non-recursive technique. 
    - consists of 2 steps: 
        1. A preliminary labeling of the image regions and
        2. Resolving cases where more than one label occurs (ie has been assigned in the previous step) in the same region. 
    - Relatively complex
    - The 2nd step is moderate memory consuming so it is a good choice under limited memory conditions. 
    - Not an issue in modern computers
